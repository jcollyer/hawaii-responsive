               <h3 class="hs3">Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p class="ps4">We never collect personal information so you never have to worry about your privacy.</p>
                <p class="ps4">Information obtained from our users will never be used or sold by third party applications.</p>
                <p class="ps4">We guarantee your privacy and will not use your email address for anything other than communication regarding your tour.</p>
                <p class="ps4">We donâ€™t collect credit card information, so we can never lose it.</p>
                <p class="ps4">We use the security of PayPal for all purchases and for the safety of our customers.</p>
                <p class="ps4"></p>

                <h3 class="hs3">Very Important!</h3>
                <p class="ps4">Before purchasing an airline ticket, complete the deposit form in order to be confirmed
for the tour. Do not purchase a ticket until Sea Hawaii Tours has notified you that you
are confirmed for the tour.</p>
                <h3 class="hs1">Who will meet me at the airport?</h3>
                <p class="ps1">Sea Hawaii Tours staff will meet you at the airport as soon as you collect your bags. We
will then meet you at <span class="ps2">Baggage Claim H</span> to coordinate your transfer to the hotel. Tour
staff will also assist in your shuttle departure back to the airport for your return flight.
If you arrive long after the meeting times, or long before, you may have to transfer to
the hotel on your own. If your flight times differ from our meeting times, call for more
information.</p>
                <h3 class="hs1">Do I need to arrive at any specific time?</h3>
                <p class="ps1">Sea Hawaii Tours asks that you try to arrive at the Honolulu International Airport
between 10am and 7pm Hawaiian time. On the return flight home, we ask that you
arrange your ticket to depart between 8am and 6pm. These specific time windows will
allow you to get the most out of your Hawaii experience and help us get you safely to and
from the airport with our shuttle company.</p>
                <h3 class="hs1">What happens if I miss my flight or it gets cancelled?</h3>
                <p class="ps1">If the airline cancels your flight and it's their fault, they must provide you with another
flight. They will also be responsible for any expenses you may incur as a result of the
cancellation. Save all receipts.
If your plane is delayed due to weather, the airline does not have to do anything other
than offer you a seat on a later flight. The airline will not pay for any extra costs you
may incur for hotels, taxicabs, food, etc.
If you miss your plane and it is your fault, the airline may charge you extra to rebook
it. You will be responsible for paying any additional costs yourself. Avoid this by
scheduling a reliable ride to the airport and give yourself plenty of time to check baggage
and get through airport security.</p>
                <h3 class="hs1">What flight information does Sea Hawaii Tours need from me after I book my ticket?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">Sea Hawaii Tours will need ALL of your flight numbers.  This includes
ALL connections arriving and departing.  We also require an airline
conformation code, ticket number, and estimated arrival and departure
times.  If we haven't received this information from you 4 weeks
before the tour begins, we may not be able to let you participate in
the tour.</p>
                <h3 class="hs1">Does the cost of the tour include airfare?</h3>
                <p class="ps1">No. You are responsible for booking our own airline tickets.</p>
                <h3 class="hs1">Can I bring a host brother, host sister, or a friend?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">Yes. All rooms are assigned to the same gender. Most students do not know anyone
before the tour begins, but everyone goes home with many new friends.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">What is included in the cost of the tour?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">The cost of a Sea Hawaii Tour includes: breakfast, dinner (all meals include beverage,
taxes and tips), entrance fees to all listed attractions, transportation while on tour, airport
transfers, hotel accommodations (quad occupancy: 4 per room, 2 per bed), professional
tour staff, chaperones, taxes, and tips.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">What other expenses will I have while on tour?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">You will need money for lunches, shopping, and other personal expenses. Budget $8 -
$10 per day for lunches, snacks, and beverages. Shopping budgets are up to you.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Is airfare included in the cost of the tour?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">No. Airfare from your local host community to the tour destination is not included in the
cost of a Sea Hawaii tour.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Do I have to have written permission from my natural parents?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">Yes, but not for us. Your exchange program will require written permission before
they will allow you to travel with Sea Hawaii Tours. Keep in mind that some exchange
organizations will accept an email from your natural parents or guardians.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Can my exchange agency refuse my request to travel?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">Yes. If your grades are not up to standard or if you are on probation for bad behavior,
you will not be allowed to take a Sea Hawaii Tour.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">When will I get more information on the tour?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">Three weeks before the tour we will send you a packet complete with all of the tour
details: guide names, contact telephone numbers, emails, and a sample tentative itinerary.
If you have any additional questions please feel free to email us.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Is there an emergency contact phone number for my parents while I am on tour?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">The Sea Hawaii Tours, LLC office will be open during business hours and during any
hours when students are flying/traveling. Students and host families will be given phone
numbers for the hotel and the guide director. We maintain a 24-hour emergency contact
telephone number while you are on tour.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Is my plane ticket refundable?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">The majority of discount airline tickets are non-refundable which means that you will not
get a refund for a ticket if you do not travel. Most airlines will allow you to use the value
of the original ticket against another ticket later. Keep in mind that there may be a ticket change fee of $100 or more.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Do I need travel insurance?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">Most students do not purchase travel insurance, but it is available. You will have to
research options on your own.</p>
                 <h2>Host Family/ Natural Family/ Exchange Coordinator/ School, FAQ's</h2>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Are these tours chaperoned?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">All Sea Hawaii Tours programs are guided, chaperoned, and supervised day and night by
our professional tour staff and chaperones from our partner exchange programs.</p>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Are there times when students are not supervised?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">Yes, but not frequently. Students are free to explore in groups of 3 or more at
educational locations (i.e., Pearl Harbor), hotel lobby/pool, malls, beaches, and other
shopping/restaurant locations.</p>
                   <h3 class="hs1">How many guides/adults will there be on a Sea Hawaii Tour?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">It depends on how many students are on tour, but we operate with 1
guide/chaperone per 12 students, which is the standard guideline set
forth by ICSEP (International Committee of Student Exchange Programs)
and NTA (National Tour Association).</p>
                 <h2>Payment Questions</h2>
                  <h3 class="hs1">Can I pay in installments?</h3>
                 <p class="ps1">Yes, after we receive your deposit form and first $100.00, the balance can be paid either
by credit card, money order or travelers checks (in installments) up until 30 days before
the tour. If you have registered online, you may log back in and make payments anytime.</p>

                  <h3 class="hs1">Can I change my mind?</h3>

$100.00 cancellation fee. If you cancel between 1-30 days before the tour date, there will
