                <img src="assets/geoff.jpg" class="pic1 right" />
                <p class="ps1">Since 2006 Sea Hawaii Tour guides have been working with each other and
thousands of students across the US to enhance the foreign exchange student experience
while studying in the states. In 2011 a group of guides that previously worked together
for various tour companies leading students on American immersion tours, decided to
form their own company and Sea Hawaii Tours was born.</p>
                <p class="ps1">We love the Hawaiian Islands and we believe that sharing our knowledge by
educating young students is one of the best ways to spread the Aloha spirit. Over the
years we have consulted with incalculable high school educators across the US and were
able to design our travel program based on ideas that were built by teachers who wanted
quality educational tours for students.</p>
                <h3 class="hs1">What we believe in</h3>
                <img src="assets/staff.jpg" class="pic1 left" />
                <p class="ps1">We believe in providing quality educational tours for students, as we know that
the education process continues well beyond the classroom. Our tours are designed to
offer students a wide range of Hawaiian experiences and opportunities to meet new
friends from across the world. All Sea Hawaii Tour guides have Masters Degrees in their
area of expertise and are Red Cross certified in Life Guarding, First Aid, Adult/Child
CPR, and AED. Our guides are bilingual and have extensive world travel experience.
Sea Hawaii Tour guides have all lived or spent extensive time on the islands making our
knowledge of Hawaiian history, culture, nature, and Polynesian life second to none. In
addition to the educational and language aspects of a Sea Hawaii Tour, we also offer
outdoor activity options like snorkeling, surfing, sailing, and hiking which are once in a
lifetime opportunities while in Hawaii.</p>
